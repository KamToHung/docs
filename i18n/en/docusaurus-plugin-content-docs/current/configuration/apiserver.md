# apiserver.yaml

The configuration file supports environment variable injection using the `${VAR:default}` syntax. If the environment variable is not set, the default value will be used.

Common practice is to inject values through different `.env`, `.env.development`, `.env.prod` files, or you can directly modify the configuration with hardcoded values.

## Chat Message Database Configuration

This configuration is specifically for storing chat messages in the backend (though it can share the same database with proxy configurations). It corresponds to the information shown in the image below:

![Chat Sessions and Messages](/img/chat_histories.png)

Currently supports 3 types of databases:
- SQLite3
- PostgreSQL
- MySQL

If you need to add support for additional databases, you can request it in the [Issue](https://github.com/mcp-ecosystem/mcp-gateway/issues) section, or you can implement the corresponding implementation and submit a PR :)

```yaml
database:
  type: "${APISERVER_DB_TYPE:sqlite}"               # Database type (sqlite, postgres, mysql)
  host: "${APISERVER_DB_HOST:localhost}"            # Database host address
  port: ${APISERVER_DB_PORT:5432}                   # Database port
  user: "${APISERVER_DB_USER:postgres}"             # Database username
  password: "${APISERVER_DB_PASSWORD:example}"      # Database password
  dbname: "${APISERVER_DB_NAME:./mcp-gateway.db}"   # Database name or file path
  sslmode: "${APISERVER_DB_SSL_MODE:disable}"       # SSL mode for database connection
```

## Gateway Proxy Storage Configuration

This is used to store gateway proxy configurations, specifically the mappings from MCP to API, as shown in the image below:

![Gateway Proxy Configuration](/img/gateway_proxies.png)

Currently supports 2 types:
- disk: Configurations are stored as files on disk, with each configuration in a separate file, similar to nginx's vhost concept, e.g., `svc-a.yaml`, `svc-b.yaml`
- db: Store in database, each configuration is a record. Currently supports three types of databases:
    - SQLite3
    - PostgreSQL
    - MySQL

```yaml
storage:
  type: "${GATEWAY_STORAGE_TYPE:db}"                    # Storage type: db, disk
  
  # Database configuration (used when type is 'db')
  database:
    type: "${GATEWAY_DB_TYPE:sqlite}"                   # Database type (sqlite, postgres, mysql)
    host: "${GATEWAY_DB_HOST:localhost}"                # Database host address
    port: ${GATEWAY_DB_PORT:5432}                       # Database port
    user: "${GATEWAY_DB_USER:postgres}"                 # Database username
    password: "${GATEWAY_DB_PASSWORD:example}"          # Database password
    dbname: "${GATEWAY_DB_NAME:./data/mcp-gateway.db}"  # Database name or file path
    sslmode: "${GATEWAY_DB_SSL_MODE:disable}"           # SSL mode for database connection
  
  # Disk configuration (used when type is 'disk')
  disk:
    path: "${GATEWAY_STORAGE_DISK_PATH:}"               # Data file storage path
```

## Notification Configuration

The notification module is primarily used to notify `mcp-gateway` of configuration updates and trigger hot reloads without requiring service restart.

Currently supports 4 notification methods:
- signal: Notify through operating system signals, similar to `kill -SIGHUP <pid>` or `nginx -s reload`. Can be triggered via the `mcp-gateway reload` command, suitable for single-machine deployment
- api: Notify through an API call. `mcp-gateway` listens on a separate port and performs hot reload when receiving requests. Can be triggered via `curl http://localhost:5235/_reload`, suitable for both single-machine and cluster deployments
- redis: Notify through Redis pub/sub functionality, suitable for both single-machine and cluster deployments
- composite: Combined notification, using multiple methods. By default, `signal` and `api` are always enabled, and can be combined with other methods. Suitable for both single-machine and cluster deployments, and is the recommended default approach

Notification roles:
- sender: Sender role, responsible for sending notifications. `apiserver` can only use this mode
- receiver: Receiver role, responsible for receiving notifications. Single-machine `mcp-gateway` is recommended to use only this mode
- both: Both sender and receiver roles. Cluster-deployed `mcp-gateway` can use this mode

```yaml
notifier:
  role: "${APISERVER_NOTIFIER_ROLE:sender}"              # Role: sender, receiver, or both
  type: "${APISERVER_NOTIFIER_TYPE:signal}"              # Type: signal, api, redis, or composite

  # Signal configuration (used when type is 'signal')
  signal:
    signal: "${APISERVER_NOTIFIER_SIGNAL:SIGHUP}"                       # Signal to send
    pid: "${APISERVER_NOTIFIER_SIGNAL_PID:/var/run/mcp-gateway.pid}"    # PID file path

  # API configuration (used when type is 'api')
  api:
    port: ${APISERVER_NOTIFIER_API_PORT:5235}                                           # API port
    target_url: "${APISERVER_NOTIFIER_API_TARGET_URL:http://localhost:5235/_reload}"    # Reload endpoint

  # Redis configuration (used when type is 'redis')
  redis:
    addr: "${APISERVER_NOTIFIER_REDIS_ADDR:localhost:6379}"                             # Redis address
    password: "${APISERVER_NOTIFIER_REDIS_PASSWORD:UseStrongPasswordIsAGoodPractice}"   # Redis password
    db: ${APISERVER_NOTIFIER_REDIS_DB:0}                                                # Redis database number
    topic: "${APISERVER_NOTIFIER_REDIS_TOPIC:mcp-gateway:reload}"                       # Redis pub/sub topic
```

## OpenAI API Configuration

The OpenAI configuration block defines settings for OpenAI API integration:

```yaml
openai:
  api_key: "${OPENAI_API_KEY}"                                  # OpenAI API key (required)
  model: "${OPENAI_MODEL:gpt-4.1}"                              # Model to use
  base_url: "${OPENAI_BASE_URL:https://api.openai.com/v1/}"     # API base URL
```

Currently only integrates OpenAI API-compatible LLMs calls
