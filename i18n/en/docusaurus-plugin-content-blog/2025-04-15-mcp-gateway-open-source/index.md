MCP Gateway is Now Open Source!

As the MCP ecosystem continues to grow, more projects and B2B services are integrating with MCP.

When moving into production environments, the challenge of integrating existing API services becomes inevitable, often requiring significant human and system resources.

Therefore, I believe the MCP ecosystem needs a "reverse proxy" tool similar to Nginx, helping individuals and enterprises quickly integrate their existing APIs into the MCP ecosystem at a low cost, enabling rapid validation of ideas and market fit without initially investing substantial resources in modifications or restructuring.

Based on this background, I've open-sourced MCPGateway, a lightweight, platform-neutral, low-overhead MCP gateway that can be quickly deployed locally, on a single machine, or on K8s. Through configuration, it can rapidly transform API services into MCP Servers.

While the future market size remains uncertain, I believe building such a tool to fill the gap and lower the entry barrier is a meaningful endeavor.

Welcome to try it out, and I'm very much looking forward to your feedback and suggestions! ❤️
